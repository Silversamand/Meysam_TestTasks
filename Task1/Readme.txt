There are 2 file servers that provide HTTP interface to view and download files. For example, they can be google drive and onedrive.
We need design of console tool that connects to specified server and
1) shows the list of user available files
2) downloads specified files and saves them locally

The result of this task is C++ classes (just interfaces without function implementation) that are needed to implement described tool.
